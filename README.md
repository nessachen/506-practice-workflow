This assignment is a primer for fall semester HHA 504/507

I wanted the my assignment to be about A1C levels.
For the number variable, I decided to make it a normal A1C level and set that equal to 5.6 which is a normal A1C value for adults. For the string variable, I decided to define A1C since it would be all text and set that equal to 'blood glucose level over past three months'. For the list, I decided to list the possible values an A1C test would yield. Anything below 5.6 is considered a normal level so I included two normal values and also two values that would be considered a diagnosis for diabetes or prediabetes. For the dictonary, I decided to make it about patients and included three of them. Then, the nested dictionary consists of the personal information for each patient which is their name, age, and A1C level.
Since A1C tests are routine and conducted about every three months, for the function I wanted to make it about the previous A1C value and the A1C value from the most recent test. I wanted the function to be able to print the result from the previous test and the most recent test when there is an example given and display it in sentence form. For the if/else statement, I wanted to compare the previous results and current results. So if the new value is less than the old value then there will be a printed statement of the new A1C value is lower now. Then, if it was anything else which would be if the new value is greater than the old value then there will be a printed statement of the new A1C value is higher now. 
For my example data, it sets the new A1C value as 5.4 and old A1C value as 7.2. As previously mentioned, the function will be putting that into sentence form so the expected output will be '7.2 is your previous A1C value' and '5.4 is your current A1C value'. For comparison of the two values, the expected output will be 'Your A1C is lower now'.
